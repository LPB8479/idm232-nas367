            <h3>Context and Challenge</h3>
            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>We needed a fully responsive website that allows users to discover and search for new recipes they can try at home. We only had one designer/developer working on this project, and he managed to put it together in only 10 weeks.</p>

            <h4>Goals</h4>
            <p>The overall goal of this project was to create a visually pleasing "online cookbook" site that people can easily use to find and learn new recipes that they can make at home. Many similar sites are only partially devoted to this purpose, often also including advertisements for various kitchen products or blog posts that make it harder for users to find what they are looking for.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The main requirements for this project were that users have a streamlined experience, can navigate the site easily on any device without running into any roadblocks and can search for recipes using a variety of search methods and criteria such as name, ingredients, cuisine, or dietary preferences.</p>

            <h3>Process & Insight</h3>
            <h4>Research</h4>
            <p>We first did some research into similar sites such as AllRecipes, BlueApron, and Epicurious. Many of these sites made it more difficult to find recipes, by adding product placements, blog posts, and tutorials that, if added on our site, would distract the user from their goal. We identified that we needed to make it as easy as possible for users to navigate the site and find what they are looking for.</p>
            <h4>Visual Style</h4>
            <p>Our next step was determining the visual style for the site. We decided on a simple, navigatable design with a bright and cheerful yellow as the main accent color. An orange and a lighter yellow are used as secondary colors to provide contrast. We also chose Nunito Sans, a simple, balanced sans-serif typeface to ensure legibility and uniformity.</p>
            <h4>Website Design</h4>
            <p>We then got to work creating a LoFi design of each key page for both desktop and mobile. We wanted to create an experience that was as simple and user-friendly as possible.</p>
            <h4>Development</h4>
            <p>The next step was to develop the site, matching the LoFi design as closely as possible. Because the designer and the developer were the same person, the design almost completely matched the developer's abilities. Only a few design elements had to be changed, such as the carousel on the mobile homepage being replaced with just a vertical list.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Next our developer added in the functionality of the site. This took a lot of trial-and-error to get all of the components and functions to work reliably with each other. The design was slightly tweaked in this stage as well, since there were some issues that hadn't been considered until the actual recipes were added. For instance, a lot of spacing had to be adjusted for text that was longer or shorter than the placeholder text used previously.</p>
            <h4>Testing and Tweaking</h4>
            <p>We then shared the almost-complete site with a small group of potential users to get feedback about the site's strengths and weaknesses. These testers not only gave us insightful comments about the user experience, but also found bugs and edge cases that our developer hadn't thought of. This step was crucial in creating a product that worked for and benefitted our users.</p>
